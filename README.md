CMU Labs is basically a LinkedIn for research @CMU: a web platform that connects CMU students to labs and research opportunities on campus. 
This builds an ecosystem where labs can reach passionate, qualified students who are excited about research. Labs can also attract eligible students to participate in their lab studies and collect data.
CMU students can connect to labs to find research opportunities that help them gain research experience. CMU Students can also participate in lab studies and be compensated in terms of money or course credit.
Ultimately, this platform creates, manages, and presents a centralized database for labs at CMU that is accessible to students.
